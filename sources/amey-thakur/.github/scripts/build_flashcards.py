Writes a tab-separated file that Anki, Quizlet, and RemNote all import
directly, plus a readable markdown version. Cards come from the exam facts,
the domain weights, the cheat sheet rules, and the glossary, so the deck stays
consistent with the documentation instead of being maintained separately.
