        <div class="col">
          <p>I sat down to prepare for these certifications and found the material scattered: the blueprint in one
          PDF, the policies in another, the courses on a platform behind a sign-in, the registration mechanics
          somewhere else again, and the practical details, the ones that actually cost people a sitting, written
          down nowhere at all.</p>
          <p>So I collected it. Every official exam guide, every policy, every course, the blueprints with their real
          weights, and the things I only learned by going through it: which domains carry the marks, which options an
          exam question is quietly steering you away from, and how much of a failed attempt is logistics rather than
          knowledge.</p>
          <p>None of this required anything you do not already have. The official material is free, the blueprints
          tell you exactly what is tested, and the rest is steady work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>What I could not do is give you the questions, and I would not if I could. Every candidate signs a
          non-disclosure agreement, and a credential is only worth holding if the people holding it earned it. So
          everything here is built from published material: the official blueprints, the published scenarios, and
          practice written from scratch against them.</p>
          <p>Read the roadmap, pick the exam that matches the work you already do, and work its page. Keep the cheat
          sheet for the day before. If a fact here disagrees with the official exam guide, believe the guide, and
          please tell me so I can fix it.</p>

          scores you per domain the way the real report does. Three timed mock exams per certification, each
          with questions that appear nowhere else, so a second sitting still measures something.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-top:4mm">Study the way you already study</h3>
          <p>A flashcard deck covering every fact, domain weight, rule, and term, in a format Anki, Quizlet, and
          RemNote all import directly. A progress tracker that weights each domain by its share of the exam, so the
          number tells you how much of the paper you can actually answer. Anthropic's own videos, including the
          complete AI Fluency course, arranged by the exam each one serves and playable in the page.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-top:4mm">A coach that knows the blueprint</h3>
          <p>Open the repository in Claude Code and six commands are waiting: run a diagnostic to find weak domains,
          drill one of them, sit a timed mock, build a study plan or a week of sessions, and interpret a real score
          report into a decision.</p>

          <h3>The official documents, kept current</h3>
          <p>Every official exam guide and policy PDF, mirrored with its source URL and the date it was last checked,
          so you can verify anything here against the original in one click. A weekly job re-checks every link, and a
          script re-downloads the documents and reports what changed.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-top:4mm">The parts that go stale fastest</h3>
          <p>Fees, discounts, question counts, and the migration-era rules change. The repository carries dated facts
          and a maintenance routine designed to catch them. When something here disagrees with the official exam
          guide, the guide is right, and the repository is where the correction lands first.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-top:4mm">Other candidates</h3>
          <p>A discussion space for preparation questions and exam experiences, under one firm rule: real exam content
