"""Check that every stated badge count matches the badges that actually exist.

The Claude Academy badge count appears in five places: the badge files
themselves, two galleries, and three sentences of prose. When a badge is added
by hand, at least one of those gets missed. It has been missed twice.

So the count is derived from the directory, and every other place has to agree
with it.

    python .github/scripts/check_badges.py

Exits non-zero on any disagreement.
