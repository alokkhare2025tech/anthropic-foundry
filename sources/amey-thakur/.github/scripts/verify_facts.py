"""Check the repository's exam facts against the official PDFs it mirrors.

Every page here carries a "facts last verified" date. That date is a claim, and
bumping it without re-reading the sources would be the exact failure this
repository exists to avoid: a confident assertion nobody checked.

So this reads the figures straight out of the mirrored exam guides and compares
them to what the markdown says. Run it before touching any verification date.

    python .github/scripts/verify_facts.py

Needs pymupdf. Exits non-zero if any published figure is missing from the docs
or disagrees with them.

What is checked, and what is not. The exam guides carry the exam codes, item
counts, duration, cut score, fees and domain weights, so all of those are
compared. The retake intervals, the twelve-month validity, the renewal terms and
the delivery and badging platforms are published on Anthropic's certification
pages rather than in any mirrored PDF, so this cannot reach them; they are
listed at the end with the sentence that carries each one, quoted from those
pages, so re-checking is reading four short paragraphs rather than a search.
