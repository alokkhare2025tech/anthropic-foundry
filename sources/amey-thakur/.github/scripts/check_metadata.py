"""Check that the citation metadata still matches the release it claims to describe.

CITATION.cff and codemeta.json both carry a version and a date. Nothing forces
them to be updated when a release is tagged, so they drift silently: a reader
who cites this repository gets a version number that was true three releases
ago, and the "Cite this repository" button hands them the wrong reference.

That is exactly what happened between v1.2.0 and v1.5.0, and neither file
complained, because they agreed with each other. Agreement is therefore not
enough on its own. This compares them to the newest tag as well.

Usage:
    python .github/scripts/check_metadata.py

The tag comparison is skipped when no tags are present, so a shallow checkout or
a fresh fork does not fail for a reason the author cannot fix. In CI, fetch tags
so the check actually runs.

Metadata ahead of the newest tag is reported but not failed. The commit that
bumps the version is pushed before the release is cut from it, so the tag does
not exist yet when CI reads that commit; failing there marked every release
commit red for a state that resolved itself minutes later. Metadata behind the
newest tag is the drift this exists to catch, and still fails.
